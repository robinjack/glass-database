Hello,

I am writing to enquire about how you are going to make data available to me as a member of the European Union post GDPR.

I have a {company_name} cookie but not an account, and I would like to exercise my right to access the data you hold that concerns me. 

I would like to know:
    1. What data will you provide?
    2. How will you provide this data?
    3. How can I go about accessing this information and proving my identity once GDPR comes in full swing?

Thanks

Robin
